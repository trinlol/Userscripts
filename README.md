## ![alt text][logo] Fix Twitch Video Controls
[logo]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trinlol/Userscripts/main/twitch-video-controls.png "Logo Title Text 2"

Fix video controls for twitch.tv.

Certain uBlock scripts / adblockers were causing the video player's options to be no longer clickable after a certain period of time. 
This script will check the page for the element that blocks the controls after an ad is played / after an ad is blocked.
