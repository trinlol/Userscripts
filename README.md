## ![alt text][logo] Twitch Video Controls
[logo]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trinlol/Userscripts/main/twitch-video-controls.png "Logo Title Text 2"

Video controls for twitch.tv outside of the video player.

Certain uBlock scripts / adblockers were causing the video player's options to be no longer clickable after a certain period of time. 

This script attempts to put those elements outside of the video player on an overlay. Tested only on Firefox.

## Installation

    
Install the script directly from [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/483649-twitch-video-controls) or view the raw code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trinlol/Userscripts/main/twitch-video-controls.js).

- Use 90% zoom level on the page, or adjust the value `top: 92%;` to your liking.
